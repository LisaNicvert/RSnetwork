METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

a. Sampling of interaction networks

Argentina 
The interaction network was sampled at one site at Parque Sierra de San Javier, Tucumán in the Andes of north-west Argentina (Blendinger et al. 2012, 2015). The network was sampled in montane forest at 1000 masl. Data were collected bi-monthly between September 2008 and August 2010, resulting in twelve temporal replicates of the network (Blendinger et al. 2012, 2015). The bi-monthly sampling started in September 2008 and in October 2009, ensuring that the twelve temporal replicates represented all months of the year. Fruit removal by fruit-eating birds was recorded on all fleshy-fruited plant species located in a 300 m × 200 m plot. At each time period, during three sampling days, five observers traversed a block of 10 x 2 contiguous 20 x 20-m cells and recorded all fruit-consumption events for 20 min per cell. The total observation time was 600 h.

Bolivia 
Interaction networks were sampled in the Andes of South West Bolivia (Saavedra et al. 2014) in the vicinity of Chulumani town in upper montane forests between 1700 and 2500 masl. Data were collected at 8 sites located in two large forest remnants. At each site, we established plots (each with a size of 100 m × 20 m) at the forest edge (10 m from the forest margin) and in the forest interior (160 m from the forest margin). Data were collected during four observation sessions, conducted during two dry seasons and two wet seasons between June 2010 and February 2012. We recorded seed removal by frugivorous birds on all fleshy-fruited plant species located in each plot. During each observation session, every plot was simultaneously observed by two observers on two consecutive days from 06:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. for a total of 24 hours. The total observation time was 768 h. Data only include legitimate seed-dispersal interactions (i.e., seed swallowing and seed removal from the tree).

Colombia
Networks were sampled at two sites in the Andes of Central Colombia (Muñoz et al. 2017). Network Colombia 1 was collected at Santuario de Flora y Fauna Otún Quimbaya in a high montane forest at 1800 masl. Network Colombia 2 was collected at Parque Regional Ucumari in upper montane forest at 2700 masl. At each location, data were collected during four time periods. Sampling was done approximately every three months between February 2012 and November 2012, resulting in four temporal replicates of each network. Two replicates cover the rainy season (May and November) and two replicates the dry season (February and August). We recorded fruit removal by frugivorous birds on all fleshy-fruited plant species located in 100 m × 20 m plots (five plots in Santuario, five plots in Ucumari). During each time period, every plot was observed on five consecutive days between dawn and noon for a total of 30 hours. The total observation time was 600 h in Colombia 1 and 600 h in Colombia 2.

Ecuador 
Networks were sampled in and around Podocarpus National Park in the south Ecuadorian Andes (Quitián et al. 2018). Network Ecuador 1 was sampled in an evergreen premontane forest at 1000 masl; network Ecuador 2 was sampled in a lower montane forest at 2000 masl; network Ecuador 3 was sampled in an upper montane forest at 3000 masl. Plant-frugivore interactions were sampled four times in 2014 and 2015, twice in the most humid season (May to July) and twice in the least humid season (October to December), resulting in four temporal replicates of each network. We recorded seed removal by frugivorous birds on all fleshy-fruited plant species located in 100 m × 30 m plots (three plots at every elevation). During each time period, every plot was observed on five consecutive days between dawn and noon for a total of 25 hours. The total observation time was 300 h for each of the three forest sites (Ecuador 1, 2, 3).

Peru
Interaction networks were sampled at two sites in the Cusco Province in the Andes of south-east Peru (Dehling et al. 2014). Network Peru 1 was collected in lower montane forest at 1500 masl. Network Peru 2 was collected in upper montane forest at 3000 masl. At each location, data were collected during four time periods. Sampling was done approximately every three months between December 2009 and September 2010, resulting in four temporal replicates of each network. The first two replicates cover the beginning and peak of the rainy season, the third and fourth replicate the beginning and peak of the dry season, respectively. We recorded seed removal by frugivorous birds on all fleshy-fruited plant species located in 100 m × 30 m plots (eight plots in San Pedro, six plots in Wayqecha). During each time period, every plot was observed on five consecutive days between dawn and noon for a total of 30 hours. The total observation time was 960 h in Peru 1 and 720 h in Peru 2 (Dehling et al. 2014).


b. Sampling of bird traits
Bird traits related to avian frugivory were collected for all bird species recorded in the interaction networks: beak length and beak width, body mass, Kipp’s index (a measure for the pointedness of the wing). Beak length, beak width and wing pointedness were measured on museum specimens following Eck et al. (2011). Beak length was measured as the distance from the commissural point of the upper and lower beak to the tip of the closed beak, and beak width (as an approximation for gape width) as the external distance between the two commissural points. Kipp’s index (i.e., hand-wing index) was measured as the distance from the tip of the first secondary to the wing tip (both measured on the folded wing), divided by wing length (measured on the lightly flattened wing). Data on body mass were compiled from Dunning (2007). If available, specimens from the same country were measured, but specimens from neighbouring countries were used if specimens from the country were not available. We aimed at measuring 2 females and 2 males of each species.

c. Sampling of plant traits
All morphological plant traits were measured in the field. For each plant recorded in the networks, we recorded fruit length and fruit diameter, plant height and crop size (the number of fruits on the plant, estimated for trees with very large crops). For epiphytes we recorded the height at which they grew. The product of mean crop size and mean fruit mass was used to estimate total fruit crop mass.
