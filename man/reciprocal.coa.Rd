\value{
Results of the reciprocal scaling.
Each row corresponds to a correspondence in the original table (a nonzero occurrence).

The first columns (\code{Scorexx}) give coordinates in the different dimensions.
\code{Scorexx} gives the coordinates of the correspondence in the multivariate
space (as given by canonical correlation analysis).

\code{Row} and \code{Col} give the row and column this correspondence belongs to.

\code{Weight} gives the correspondence weight (the count of the original cell divided
by the sum of the table).
